#### Code Design

The program has two pointers left and right, left is used to keep track of the position to put 0, right to keep track of the position to put 2. Index is the variable to iterate through the array and help swap the current index value with either left pointer value or right pointer value.

#### Efficiency

Time efficiency would be O(n) as the program only iterates through the input list once. Space efficiency would be O(1) because the listed is sorted in place.
