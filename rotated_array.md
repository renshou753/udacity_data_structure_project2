#### Code Design

The order may not be correct for a rotated sorted array, binary search was used to divide the array into halves then try to identify which half of the array the element is in then gradually limit the scope.

#### Efficiency

Time efficiency would be O(log n) for binary search algorithm, storage efficiency would be O(1).
