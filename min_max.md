#### Code Design

The program is relatively simple, I used min_n and max_n variable to keep track of the minimum and maximum number within the loop, if current iteration number in the list is smaller than the min_n then change the value of min_n to that iteration number, then at the end of the loop I will have the minimum and maximum number respectively for the list.

#### Efficiency

Time efficiency would be O(n) since the program only loops through the input list once, space complexity would be O(1).
